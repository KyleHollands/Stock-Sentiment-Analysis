As an investor part-time, I realized quickly there are many degrees of tools and methodologies that can be utilized to attempt to
discern the movement of a stock, whether through technical analysis or fundamental analysis. 

I decided it may be interesting to try and discern short-term (or long-term) movement by analyzing the recent emotions and indicators from
the general public/investors discussing the stock. 

This is an early attempt at that, by leveraging information from one of the largest websites when it comes to public discussion of a stock.
